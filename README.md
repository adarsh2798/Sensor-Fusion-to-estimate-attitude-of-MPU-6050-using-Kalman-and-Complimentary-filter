# Sensor-Fusion-to-estimate-attitude-of-MPU-6050-using-Kalman-and-Complimentary-filter

Attitude estimation was performed for IMU sensor MPU-6050 by fusing readings of accelerometer and gyroscope using:

## 1. KALMAN FILTER :
   Implemented 9-state kalman filter in MATLAB by considering error state models for orientation,gyro offset and linear accceleration.

## 2. COMPLIMENTARY FILTER
Implemented a quaternion based Complimentary Filter in MATLAB to estimate orientation of IMU by fusing acceleormeter and gyro readings. Detailed report [here]()
